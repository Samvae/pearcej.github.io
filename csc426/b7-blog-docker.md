## Blog Prompt on Docker

Read the following:

- [What is a Docker Image](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/Docker-image)
- [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)
- [Docker vs Virtual Machine â€“ Understanding the Differences](https://geekflare.com/docker-vs-virtual-machine/)
- Open Docker Desktop and do all eight of the available walkthroughs:
  - What is a container?
  - How do I run a container?
  - Run Docker Hub Images
  - Multi-container applications
  - Persist your data between containers
  - Access your local folder from a container
  - Containerize your application
  - Publish your image

In this blog post, address each of the following bullets (1 or more paragraphs each):

- Discuss your understanding of Docker, and the advantages and disadvantages for the choice of using Docker for work in open source.
- What is something that you learned or found interesting in these readings and what is something that you either found confusing or didn't understand or disagreed with?
- Reflect on what you learned in each of the walkthroughs. What was the purpose of each walkthrough? What did you learn from each one? What was the most interesting or confusing part of each one?

Next find two more articles that serve to further address what you found interesting or confusing in these articles.
 - Write at least one more paragraph that discussed what you learned from these additional sources. Link these references in your blog AND add a references section at the bottom of your post with formal APA style citations for each. 


### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
