## Final Portfolio

Submit a professionally-written single-spaced portfolio document to Moodle which includes the following sections:

1. A high-level overwiew of the issue(s) you solved from the opensource and cppds textbooks. What kinds of issues did you take on and what was the result? Choose a couple that you are particularly proud of and please give specifics with book names, issue numbers as well as a description of what you did and what you are proud of that is easy to understand.

2. An detailed overview of all of the issues that you and/or your team worked on in the later part of the course, including the issue number, and easy to understand description of the issues, a summary of the progress your team made including pull request numbers (if any; if none, then summarize each of your attempts), and if you did not complete the issue(s) detail what you did to make it/them easy for someone else in the open source community to utilize your progress to complete and close. Assume that your reader has general familiarity with Runestone, but nothing more. Be sure to include images or screenshots. (3+ paragraphs)

3. A detailed summary of each team member's contributions, including your own. I'm interested in what you each did rather than your dynamics, which you'll address in your Final Team Evaluation. (3+ paragraphs; 1+ on each team member)

4. Links to the two blog entries that you are most proud of and would feel comfortable sharing with a potential employer. Include a paragraph explaining why you chose these two entries. (link + 1 paragraph)

5. A refection on the level of professionalism and community-mindededness that you brought to interactions with both this class's community *and* the greater Runestone community. Did you help others beyond your particular team?  If so, give specific examples of your posts in our class Slack channel and/or the Runestone Discord channel. In addition, did you effectively utilize the Runestone #developer or #general Discord channels? If so, how effectively? Explain. Did you thank those who offered you assistance? Give examples. Did you utilize the comments feature in the issue queue and in your pull-requests effectively? Explain and give details. Also reflect honestly on how you might have been more community-minded and/or more effective in your communications.

6. A reflection on your overall experience in the class and working on Runestone. You are free to highlight what is most important to you, although be sure to answer the following at minimum (1 page):

  - What is the most valuable or interesting thing you learned this term from this project?
  - What recommendations do you have for me as a long-time member of the Runestone community?
  - What changes would you like to see in the class structure the next time it is offered?
  - What advice would you give to a future Open Source Software Engineering student?

Because I do not measure your success in the number of pull-requests, your portfolio helps me to understand in a broader sense what you have accomplished this term. You should consider it a professional document; it should be well-written, well-edited, and entirely your own writing. (Remember that along with your team's presentation, it is worth 25% of your course grade!)

### This portfolio is due by 8:00 am on Reading Day, Monday, December 11, 2023.
