## Blog Prompt on the Monorepo and server structure

My apologies for the length of this reading, but I think it will be very useful. Go to the [Runestone Documentation](https://runestone-monorepo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and click all of the links under both Welcome to Runestone documentation and API Documentation sections.

Write a full blog post which should be the length of a typical blog post from Medium. Be sure to explore and discuss your understanding of the main components of Runestone, what they each do, and which of them relate to your current issue.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.
- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.

### This entry is due by 8 am on the day of our next class
