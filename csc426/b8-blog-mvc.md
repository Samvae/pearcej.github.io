## Blog Prompt on MVC and Web2py

Read the following:

  - Read [What Is a Web Application?](https://mikkegoes.com/what-is-a-web-application/)
  - Read [MVC Framework Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvc-framework-introduction/)
  - Read [What Is the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern?](https://mikkegoes.com/model-view-controller-mvc/)
  - Read [Web2py Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/web2py/index.htm)
  - Next find and read three more articles that serve to further address what you found interesting or confusing in these articles.

Write a full blog post which should be the length of a typical blog post from Medium. Be sure to explore and discuss your understanding of each of the concepts as well as how these concepts relate to each other and to runestone.

### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

  - Post your entry to your blog.
  - Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
