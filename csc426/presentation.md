## Final Team Presentation

The final team presentation will be a 10 minute presentation to the class using slides. Each one of you must contribute to the creation of as well as the delivery of this presentation.

Your presentation should include the following:

1. A summary, in plain English, of the issue(s) that your team claimed, including:
  - Describe in detail the steps you undertook to understand the issue.
  - Did you research a solution in Stack Overflow, read the documentation, ask for clarification in slack, etc.?
  - Did you ask questions in the Runestone #developer Discord channel? 
2. Your team's approach to tackling the issue, including:
  - How did you divide and assign tasks?
  - How often did you meet or keep in touch outside of class?
3. A walkthrough of the files involved and changes made, including:
  - What is the function/purpose of each file that you edited?
  - Highlight and explain any changes that you made.
  - What is the current state of the issue? (Were you able to submit one or more PRs? If so, what is the status of them?)
4. A description of the obstacles your team encountered, including:
  - Detailing the steps did you undertook to overcome them.
  - Do you believe that you were successful in doing so? Why or why not?
5. Reflections
  - What did you learn?
  - What would you do differently next time?
  - What would have equipped you better for success?

Note that the slides should NOT try to cover all of the above in full sentences on the slides. Think about using bullets and how you can get the information across in a visually interesting or creative way!
