## Blog Prompt

In this blog post, address each of the following bullets:

1. Note that the work that underlays this blog post must not be undertaken too late. Explain why.
  
2. Carefully document your process on your blog as you very slowly and very deliberately follow the posted instructions to set up the development environment that begin at [https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/rs](https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/rs). For this you have one week, and I expect you to demonstrate your understanding of the Runestone community by getting started on this early and seeking help appropriately in the appropriate Runestone communication channels. (You are encouraged also to use Slack to help others, but note that solely last ditch requests for help will not be seen positively, and your grade will reflect that.)

2. Identify all challenges you faced, exactly when you faced them, what you did to overcome each of them, and why your approach is one that demonstrates you professionalism. Explain.

3. Discuss what you are most proud of in this installation process and what do you regret. Explain in at least a paragraph.

 
### Remember in order to receive credit for each blog entry, you must do *both* of the following:

- Post your entry to your blog.

- Additionally, copy and paste the text of your entry to Moodle. (This should only take a couple of minutes.)

The best blog entries will be honest, thoughtful, and critically reflective. Here are some [blog examples](blogreflection.md)
of the differences between reporting, reflection, and critical reflection.
